# MCDEX bounties

We created this repository to aid and support community initiative. MCDEX Bounties exists to nurture the talents found within the MCDEX community, to propel this Network to the next level.

# So what can community members do?
Community is at the forefront of MCDEX. Members can participate in a number of technical and non-technical projects, and be rewarded for their hard work.
